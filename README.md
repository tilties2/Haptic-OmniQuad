## Description

Fully actuated aerial robot proved their superior-ity for Aerial Physical Interaction (APhI) over the past years, nevertheless their complexity make them hard to access for most
of research center. This work wants to enhance accessibility of these technologies presenting a minimal setup for aerial telemanipulation. The design and the control of 4-degrees of freedom (DoF) haptic joystick is detailed. It enhance current form factor Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) Remote Controller (RC) with the sense of touch for the operator. The goal is to give operators an extra sense (more than vision, and sound) to help them performing APhI. On the other hand we optimized in term of weight and force the frame design of an Omnidirectional Micro Aerial Vehicle (OMAV). By reducing the number of components, we aim an simplified maintenance of such machine.
